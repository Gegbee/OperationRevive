        <h2>> The 1997 Murder of Royce Brown</h2>
        <p>In 1997, Royce Brown was found left for dead in a back alley. 
        He was brought to the hospital, but despite efforts died 32 minutes later.</p> 
        <h2>> This is Your Job</h2>
        <p>Two days ago a hard drive containing old case files was found. 
        Every case on the hard drive was solved except one labeled "Royce97". 
        Your job is to use the files in the folder to solve the case and bring justice to Royce's family.</p> 
        <h2>> What's next?</h2>
        <p>Click the file system to start investigating. 
        There are four categories of evidence {POI(person of interest) interviews, crime scene report, suspects and victim backgrounds, redacted phone messages}. 
        Use each of the pieces of evidence to write down notes and come to a conclusion.
