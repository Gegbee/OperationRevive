# Operation Revive

Operation Revive is a web based murder mystery game, where you play as a detective who has been assigned to review the contents of an old hard drive from 1997. Multiple unsolved case files are left on the hard drive, the first being "Royce97".

## The Task

It is your job to make what will further be known as "Operation Revive", and solve these cases by examining the old interviews, body autopsies, and more from each murder. Once you have decided on the murderer, submit their name to the county and bring justice to their family.
